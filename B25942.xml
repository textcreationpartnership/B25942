            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> Proposal <hi>to Prevent the</hi> Corruption of the Coyn.</head>
            <p>'TIS too well known how much the <hi>Coyn</hi> of this Nation was injur'd before the last general <hi>Melting;</hi> near a third part of the whole was lost; which Loss arose chiefly by its being so exorbitantly <hi>Clipt,</hi> but partly by its being <hi>Corrupted.</hi> This Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble House has prevented the Return of the first Evil, but the latter is still growing upon us, and may in time appear as formidable a Mischief as the <hi>Clipping</hi> did, unless some way be found out to check it; for we see daily a Multitude of <hi>False Money</hi> run in Mixture with the <hi>Good;</hi> and the Quantity increases so fast, that the longer the Remedy is delay'd, the more difficult it will prove.</p>
            <p>To prevent this, there has been hitherto no Provision made, but only one <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> that commands and requires all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons concern'd in the Receipt of His Majesty's <hi>Revenue,</hi> to <hi>Cut</hi> and <hi>Destroy</hi> all Pieces of Counterfeit Money that comes to their Hands; which <hi>Act</hi> perhaps is faithfully executed; but with humble Submission we don't find that <hi>Act</hi> sufficient.</p>
            <p>Because first, the <hi>Act</hi> is not only limited to the Offices of the <hi>Revenue,</hi> but it seems to want a Penalty to enforce it with the utmost Severity.</p>
            <p>But the greater Reason is, that by being only directed to such who are concern'd in the publick <hi>Revenue,</hi> it leaves all other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at Liberty to do what they please; and 'tis easie to guess what Abuses are made of such an Indulgence: For while the <hi>Bank</hi> and <hi>Bankers,</hi> the several <hi>Companies,</hi> and other <hi>Private Dealers,</hi> have it at their Pleasure to take or return to their Customers that <hi>Base Money</hi> that ought to be destroy'd, no doubt but such a Liberty makes 'em act more for their own Interest than the Publick: So that while this Liberty is allow'd, 'tis impossible our <hi>Cash</hi> can be kept clean, there being so many <hi>Passes</hi> for the <hi>Bad</hi> to escape: In such a Distress certainly there's a Necessity of doing something to prevent it; but what that is to be, best becomes the Wisdom of this <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Assembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to this, a Proposal was presented last Session to this Effect:
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>That an</hi> Act of Parliament <hi>should be made to compel all Persons whatsoever, (as well as them concern'd in the</hi> Revenue) <hi>under some severe Penalty, to</hi> Cut <hi>and</hi> Deface <hi>all Pieces of Money that should be tender'd in Payment, and discover'd to be</hi> Counterfeit.</item>
                  <item>II. <hi>That there shou'd be no manner of Liberty to return such</hi> Money <hi>to the Owner, nor to connive at the issuing of it any way, till it was first</hi> Defac'd, <hi>and made incapable of passing again.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. <hi>That when such</hi> Money <hi>was</hi> Defac'd, <hi>it should be return'd to the Owner.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. <hi>That if by Negligence or Mistake any</hi> False Money <hi>escape any Clerk or Receiver in the several Offices of the</hi> Revenue, <hi>such Money shou'd be</hi> Cut <hi>by him who next finds it, and he who received it to suffer the Loss.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>Proposal</hi> admitting of some Objections, was not thought so practicable as so important an Affair ought to be, so that it were happy if something else cou'd be thought of more effectual: I believe every good Subject wishes this Reformation were made, but what Means shall we propose to effect it? There the Question stands, and 'twou'd be a fortunate Discovery if we cou'd fall upon such Measures as wou'd render the Project successful.</p>
            <p>But that's not so easie; and tho' there's a fatal Necessity of arming against this Intestine Enemy, yet it's a hard Matter to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what Arms we shall use; and after our utmost Speculations there will not appear a Method more probable than that already mention'd, or this which follows, propos'd to be by a <hi>general Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Oath</hi> is the most sacred Pledge our Consciences can bear; 'tis the last Evidence in Law, upon which the Foundation and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of Justice chiefly subsists; and when no other Fetters will bind up the Hands of the Libertine, an <hi>Oath</hi> ties him down, and keeps him within the Check of his Conscience.</p>
            <p>Therefore with great Resignation to the Wisdom of this Honourable House, it is Proposed as the most effectual way to oppose the <hi>Counterfeiting</hi> of the <hi>Coyn,</hi> and the suppressing that which is now running, and so by degrees to <hi>Purge</hi> the whole Nation of it, as thus.</p>
            <list>
               <head>
                  <hi>The</hi> PROPOSAL.</head>
               <item>
                  <hi>I.</hi> That a solemn Oath be made, strict and ingaging to the Conscience, to oblige all Persons of all Circumstances and Conditions, who are suppos'd to be conversant in Money (except such as are hereafter excepted) to receive to the best of their Knowledge no Money, but what they shall verily believe to be Standard Gold and Standard Silver.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>II.</hi> That all concern'd in His Majesties Revenue and Exchequer, Tellers of the Bank, Cashiers of Companies, Goldsmiths, Merchants, Shopkeepers and all Tradesmen, with their Servants, or whomsoever they employ, in taking or paying Money, all Stewards, Drovers, Carriers, and all other Persons conversant in Money (Noblemen excepted) to take this Oath.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>III.</hi> And as this Oath is to be taken by Servants as well as Masters, so it shall be understood to be sufficient once to have taken it, and never to be requir'd again.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>IV.</hi> No Person to be capable of receiving the Sum of Five Pounds, till he has first taken the Oath, unless it be in case of Minority, provided for in the next Article.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>V.</hi> That all under the age of Eighteen, who are suppos'd incapable of taking an Oath, shall be ty'd up in their Indentures to the same purpose, as if they were actually sworn.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>VI.</hi> That by virtue of the same Oath, all Persons shall be obliged to Cut and Deface all Counterfeit Money, and to render it for ever incapable of passing.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>VII.</hi> That if by mistake any one receive a piece or more of false Money, and discovers it afterwards to be so, he shall be oblig'd by the same Oath not to offer it in Payment, but to deface it, tho' it be his own.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>VIII.</hi> This Oath to be administred by the next Justice, and a Certificate to be given to vouch for the same.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>IX.</hi> That a Register be made to record the Certificates, and kept by the Minister, or chief Officer of the Parish.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>X.</hi> That the Charge of the Oath and Recording be very easie, and the Profits arising from it be a Consideration to those who are employ'd in the Registry.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>And tho' at first Appearance this Proposal of Swearing seems troublesome, yet why shou'd it be thought more troublesome than the Oath of Allegiance, which was given to all the Nation? And when it is made a Case of Conscience to utter any False and Counterfeit Money, it will be an Encouragement to all</hi> Good People, <hi>and a Terror to all</hi> Evil; <hi>for than this nothing can be more solemn and aweful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Prejudices which we feel in Gold Coyns, and for the rectifying the Currency of Guineas, 'tis further humbly offer'd, That some Order be made, that all Light Guineas, under such a Weight as shall seem convenient to this Honourable House, may be Cut in sunder, and Return'd to the Payer; a reasonable Allowance for Wear of such Coyned in King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and the late King's time, to Six Grains; and in this present Reign, to Four Grains. And when this Proposal shall be approv'd and made a Law, 'tis hop'd it may be the Means of preventing the running of False, and preserving the Good Money from Diminution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that this Honourable House may take into Consideration so necessary a Work, and, among the rest of your good Decrees, may form such an Act, whether according to this Proposal or any other, as may put a Stop to the present Run of bad Money, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it hereafter, and make the Nation easie from this Perplexity, is the sincere Desire and Design of the Author of this Paper.</hi>
